# Our Goal  

The first annual Brown Unconference is an opportunity for researchers across Brown University to come together to explore advances in computational sciences at the intersection between brain and cognitive science, biology, data science, and AI.


# Important Dates

* Abstract Submission Deadline: June 15, 2020
* Conference: June 29-30, 2020

# Schedule 

The schedule will be announced closer to the date of the conference. The conference will offer multiple ways to contribute and present. Across the two days of the conference, Brown community members are invited to submit abstracts for two types of talks:

* Lightning talks: 2-3 minute talks, allowing those who may be in the early stages of their research to introduce themselves, share their interests, pitch projects, or simply network with other members of the conference
* Short talks: 12 minute talks, for those who would like to present their research. Presented research can be in progress and data can be preliminary.

For students who do not have research to present but would like to connect with other members of the Brown community, contigent on interest, we will be hosting networking and social events.

# Goals
The purpose of the Brown Unconference is to celebrate the scientific advances happening throughout the university, and allow for further collaboration across departments.
