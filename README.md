## Our Goal  

The first **Brown Unconference** is a remote gathering which provides an opportunity for researchers across campus to come together and explore advances in computational sciences at the intersection of data science and AI with other sciences including biology, physics, chemistry, engineering,  neuroscience and cognitive science.

Our goal is to foster an accessible and welcoming environment open to members of the Brown community across all disciplines and levels of expertise. We want to celebrate Brown’s uniqueness and help foster collaborations across disciplines.  Students and postdocs are especially encouraged to present their research to the broader community. The Unconference will include opportunities to meet researchers across scientific interests, hear from invited speakers, and receive feedback from diverse points of view.

We encourage submissions at all points of the scientific process.
