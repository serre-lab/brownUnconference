Despite its ubiquity, social prediction poses a generalization problem that remains poorly understood: we can neither assume that others will simply repeat their past behavior in new settings, nor that their future actions are entirely unrelated to the past. Here we demonstrate that humans solve this challenge using a structure learning mechanism that uncovers other people’s latent, unobservable motives, such as greed and risk aversion. In three studies, participants were tasked with predicting the decisions of another player in multiple unique economic games. Participants achieved accurate social prediction by learning the hidden motivational structure underlying the player’s actions. This motive-based abstraction enabled participants to attend information diagnostic of the player’s next move and disregard irrelevant contextual cues. Moreover, participants who successfully learned another’s motives were more strategic in a subsequent competitive decision task with that player, reflecting the adaptive value of social prediction in everyday life. These findings demonstrate that advantageous social behavior hinges on parsimonious and generalizable mental models that leverage others’ goals and intentions.",No,,

However, modeling such behavior has been a long effort. Although various models have been published, few is perceptually plausible for human pedestrians. Major classes of pedestrian models rely on direct input of distance and velocity without explaining how pedestrians acquire this information. In other words, these models are based on unjustified assumptions on human perception, whereas a better model should be based on the control laws of behavior. The research I will present is about building a model of avoiding moving obstacles using visual information as the control variable. ",Yes,,

However, CNNs may not have sufficient robustness when presented with challenging or new scenarios (e.g, from unstructured or changing environments). Alternatively, algorithms based on Monte-Carlo
sampling have been widely adapted in robotics and other areas of engineering due to their performance robustness. However, these sampling-based approaches have high computational requirements, making them unsuitable for real-time applications with
tight energy constraints. In this talk, I will present our work on 6 degree-offreedom
(6DoF) pose estimation for robot manipulation using this method, which uses rendering combined with sequential Monte-Carlo sampling. While potentially very accurate, the significant computational complexity of the algorithm makes it less attractive for mobile robots, where runtime and energy consumption are tightly constrained. To address these challenges, we present a novel hardware implementation of Monte-Carlo sampling on an
FPGA with lower computational complexity and memory usage, while achieving high parallelism and modularization. Our results show 12X–21X improvements in energy efficiency over low-power and high-end GPU implementations, respectively. Moreover, we

Despite their strengths, neural networks have several shortcomings, such as their need for extremely large training sets, their “black box” decision making, and their inability to recover from incorrect inference.  In addition, the computational and energy resources needed to train these discriminative models can be quite immense, as they often require weeks or even months to adequately train.  Hybrid discriminative-generative algorithms offer a promising avenue for robust perception by balancing computational complexity with explainability and reasoning.  However, this approach may still not provide for real-time response to complex tasks, even after careful optimization.  Instead, we propose human-robot learning combined with complexity-aware computing to attain energy efficient real-time machine learning.  As a first goal, this research project seeks to explore how humans and intelligent computers can collaborate effectively by integrating technical functions with human cognitive processes.  A second goal is to develop complexity and energy optimized computing solutions.  The overall objective is to minimize energy consumption, improve response time, and be more likely to optimize users’ needs. ",Yes,,

One network has n inputs (seed) while another has n-1 inputs (subseed) where the excluded variable is being evaluated.

In particle physics at hadron colliders such as the LHC, jet classification is the task of separating sprays of particles emerging from the decay of different elementary particles called quarks using their properties. In the last few years, such algorithms have benefited from the use of increasingly complex deep neural network architectures. This challenging classification task has been a key element of analyses studying the coupling of the Higgs boson to quarks. Improved performance are now allowing to probe physics processes thought to be unreachable. Brown CMS group has been historically involved in developing algorithms to classify jets, study the agreement between simulation and the data taken with the CMS detector, and deriving corrections to the simulation to match the data.

The talk will cover the strategy followed during the last years to improve performance of algorithms, as well as two analyses who benefited from such developments and allowed to probe with unprecedented precision the coupling of the Higgs boson to quarks. It will open on some new challenges particle physics is facing, related to the use of more and more advanced machine learning techniques.

However, it is unclear how these two forms of incentives differentially influence the amount and type of cognitive control a person chooses to allocate. To address this question, we had participants perform a self-paced incentivized cognitive control task, varying the magnitude of reward for a correct response and punishment for an incorrect response. Formalizing control allocation as a process of adjusting parameters of a drift diffusion model (DDM), we show that participants engaged in different strategies in response to variability in reward (adjusting drift rate) versus punishment (adjusting response threshold). We demonstrate that this divergent set of strategies is optimal for maximizing reward rate while minimizing effort costs. Finally, we show that these dissociable patterns of behavior enable us to estimate the motivational salience of positive versus negative incentives for a given individual.",Yes,,

Up to one third of these cases do not respond to standard psychotherapeutic or pharmacological treatments and are classified as Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). In addition to mood state impairment, deficits in cognitive control have been observed in TRD. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has shown promise for treatment of TRD and improvement of cognitive deficits. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are unknown both for observed cognitive impairment in TRD and symptom improvement caused by DBS. This study focuses on characterizing neural activity in the theta band (4-7 Hz), which is hypothesized to be involved in cognitive control, and understanding how this activity is affected by DBS in TRD. Intracranial recordings were performed in a patient with TRD (n = 1) during a parametric cognitive control task before and after DBS. In the task, the patient was presented with a field of randomly moving colored dots and was instructed to ignore distractors to report the most prevalent color.

A web surfer keen to learn about a topic explores a part of the network, and she is exposed to different, often opposing views. We say a surf is biased if all of the visited pages express the same view. If the topology of the links directs most of the users to biased surfs we say the network is ``structurally biased''

This work aims to define and measure structural bias in a network, and to suggest algorithms to decrease it. Assuming that pages in the network are labeled blue or red, we provide the following contributions:  
Firstly, for any page in the network, we define its ``bubble diameter'' to be the expected number of steps a surfer needs to take to visit a page of the opposite color. Secondly, to measure the structural bias of the network, we suggest efficient algorithms to find ``bad'' pages in the network: those pages whose bubble diameter is high. Thirdly, we devise efficient algorithms to modify the network and decrease the structural bias with little modification. Eventually, we apply our methods on real networks, i.e. Wikipedia and Amazon, and compare our results to other approaches.",Yes,,

The S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 S spike protein functions to bind the virus to the target cell surface. Binding of the virus to the cell surface is followed by penetration of the virus into the interior of the target cell. An immunological study of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 domain is presented here. This study provides computational descriptions of the S1 protein B-cell epitopes. The goal of these computations is to guide and facilitate the development of the urgently needed, clinically potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
    The amino acid sequence of the S1 region of the S spike protein of QHD43416 SARS-Cov-2 virus was downloaded from the NCBI website. B-cell scores were calculated for the downloaded S1 amino acid sequence with IEDB BepiPred-2.0 Sequential B-cell Epitope Predictor. Further computational processing of the immunological scores was performed with Anaconda Python 3.7.6 on a HP desktop computer running Windows 10.
 
    There are 672 amino acid positions in the coronavirus S1 domain under study. The IEDB version 2 scores computed for these S1 positions are shown in the above figure. Because of the potential medical significance of coronavirus immuno-activity, this initial study focuses on those S1 positions with the greatest predicted epitope scores. As shown as red circles in the above figure, seven peptides were observed in the S1 domain with IEDB BepiPred-2.0 scores of all component amino acids equal to or greater than 0.6 IEDB units. The positions and amino acid sequences of these seven predicted epitopic peptide components of the viral S1 protein are:

To improve the generalization capabilities of the deep model, we adopt a learning scheme to train two related tasks simultaneously. One is the original task (target), and the other is an auxiliary task (source). In order to create a related auxiliary task, we leverage an available knowledge graph to query for semantically related concepts that are grounded in labeled images; hence we call our method KGAuxLearn. We jointly train the target and source tasks in a multi-task architecture. We evaluate our method on two fine-grained visual categorization benchmarks: Oxford Flowers 102 and CUB-200-2011. Our experiments demonstrate that the error rate reduced by at least 2.1% over fine- tuning for both datasets.

Link placement is the product of people's collaboration, consequently Wikipedia naturally inherits human bias. Due to the high influence that links' disposition has on users' navigation sessions, one needs to verify that, given a controversial topic, the hyperlinks' network does not expose users to only one side of the subject. A Wikipedia's topic-induced network that prevents users the discovery of different facets of an issue, suffers from structural bias. In this work, we define the static structural bias, which indicates if the strength of connections between pages of contrasting inclinations is the same, and the dynamic structural bias, which quantifies the network's level bias that users face over the course of their navigation sessions. 
Our measurements of structural bias on several controversial topics demonstrate its existence, revealing that users have low likelihood of reaching pages of opposing inclination from where they start, and that they navigate Wikipedia showing a behavior much more biased than the expected from the baselines. Our findings advance the relevance of the problem and pave the way for developing systems that automatically measure and propose hyperlink locations that minimize the presence and effects of structural bias.",Yes,,

Over the past few years, the Brown Molecular Informatics team has been developing new ways of storing information in and computing with small molecules. While our team has clearly demonstrated how to store information in thousands of small molecules by using the presence or absence of molecules in mixtures to encode bits (see Arcadia et al., Nature Communications (2020) and Kennedy et al., PLoS One (2020)), it is less clear to us - as well as the much larger community - how to compute using molecules. One way to perform chemical computation is to use chemical reaction networks (CRNs), which consist of molecules interconnected with each other by chemical reactions with different rate constants. In principle, a sufficiently large reaction network with a variety of rate constants should be Turing complete, but no one has yet mapped out which reaction networks correspond to which computations and how to build more complex computations modularly. 
Here, I will describe an idea to learn these mappings via machine learning. Given a function one would like the network to compute that can be used as a cost function, the rate constants and structures of the networks can be learned. It should be noted that these reaction networks can be translated into sets of coupled ordinary differential equations. I would therefore love to obtain advice from data scientists and mathematicians who may have tried to perform similar mappings in other contexts before. Ultimately, this learning will be used to identify real organic reactions that can be used to perform valuable computations. ",Yes,,

This issue has stimulated an interest in the inductive biases that humans and animals employ to constrain learning in complex natural environments. While the neural mechanisms used to implement inductive biases could be informative for both improving AI and providing a better mechanistic understanding of learning, these neural underpinnings remain elusive. Here we explore the possibility that stimulus-independent pairwise correlations between neurons, or so-called noise correlations, might reflect inductive biases used to constrain learning to specific task-relevant dimensions. We test this idea with a neural network model of a two-alternative forced-choice perceptual discrimination task in which the correlation among similarly tuned units can be manipulated independently of the overall population signal-to-noise ratio. Higher noise correlations among similarly tuned units, which emerge naturally through Hebbian learning, led to faster and more robust learning through weight adjustments that favored homogenous weights assigned to neurons within a functionally similar pool. These results suggest that noise correlations may serve to reduce the dimensionality of learning thereby making it more rapid and robust. ",No,,

The pulvinar provides the primary thalamic input to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Both the pulvinar and the PPC are known to be important for visuospatial attention (VSA). Previously, we showed that neuronal activity in the PPC correlates with onset of the visual stimuli, decision-making, task-relevant locations, and behavioral outcomes. We hypothesized that the pulvinar supports these functions. Accordingly, we recorded neuronal activity in the pulvinar in rats during performance on a VSA task designed to engage goal-directed, top-down attention and stimulus-driven, bottom-up attention. Rats monitored three locations for the brief appearance of a target stimulus and approached the correct target location for a liquid reward. We analyzed behavioral epochs demarcated by stimulus onset, selection behavior, and reward approach. Neurons in the pulvinar signaled stimulus onset and selection behavior consistent with the interpretation that the pulvinar is engaged in both bottom-up and top-down visuospatial attention.

Carney Institute for Brain Science, Brown University

The neural circuits that give rise to color constancy, the ability to perceive surface color under a changing illumination, are still poorly understood. While there is growing evidence of complementary roles for both classical (CRF) and extra-classical receptive fields (eCRF) in biological color constancy, Land’s celebrated Retinex algorithm has remained the standard for the past several decades even though it makes no clear distinction between CRF and eCRF. 

We investigated the roles of CRFs and eCRFs in color constancy by creating a differentiable approximation of the neural circuit model of Mely et al (2018), which leveraged constraints from physiology and anatomy to simulate contextual illusions spanning visual modalities. When trained for color constancy on computer vision benchmarks, a single layer of this network was competitive with much larger state-of-the-art models, while also exhibiting illusory induction effects that are consistent with human psychophysics data. Lesioning model eCRFs significantly decreased performance and destroyed induction. Furthermore, correcting model sensitivity to color illusions worsened color constancy, indicating that they represent features — not bugs — of neural circuits optimized for color constancy. Our study offers direct evidence for recurrent circuits’ contribution to color constancy, revising extant theory on the computations involved in color perception.",Yes,,

(1) What problems does the system solve (computational)? (2) How does it solve these problems (algorithmic)? (3) What is the physical instantiation of the system's computations (implementation)? This framework has dominated systems and computational neuroscience research over the past 20 years, providing much needed theoretical context to brain sciences, while also siloing progress at each level of analysis. For instance, recurrent neural mechanisms, such as those that give rise to so-called classical vs. extra classical receptive fields (CRF vs. eCRF), are well studied at the level of their “implementation” via feedforward/recurrent inhibition/excitation. However, it is still unclear how these neural mechanisms give rise to network level phenomena at algorithmic or computational levels of analysis. Here, we develop an approach for understanding recurrent vision at all three of Marr’s levels of analysis. We develop a recurrent visual model with circuits inspired by those in primate visual cortex and optimize it for object segmentation in natural images. This model learns algorithms for object segmentation which compute low-level gestalt and exhibit contextual illusions. At the same time, the model’s responses to orientation stimuli explain CRF and eCRF effects observed in primate visual cortex. Through lesion studies, we demonstrate the relative importance of phenomena at implementational and algorithmic levels for performance at the computational level.

While PFC neural activity encodes a variety of task-relevant variables, the format or geometry of this code and its relationship to flexibility remain obscure. An important property of a representational geometry is dimensionality, which balances a critical trade-off between separability and generalizability. High-dimensional representations of task variables may support flexible control by providing an expressive basis set for implementing arbitrary tasks. Lower-dimensional representations may afford robustness against noise and generalize to similar tasks. In highly trained macaques, lateral PFC representations of task variables approach maximum possible dimensionality, and predict success on the task. It is unclear whether this finding will generalize to humans, who are able to perform a diverse array of novel tasks with far less training. Probing representational geometry in human PFC has been hampered by the relatively low reliability of fMRI BOLD activity patterns. To circumvent this obstacle, we develop an alternate fMRI adaptation approach which leverages neuron-level repetition suppression effects to estimate dimensionality. We show that our approach can recover ground-truth dimensionality from simulated fMRI data.

At the same time, there is a growing body of literature demonstrating that recurrent connections improve the learning efficiency and generalization of vision models on classic computer vision challenges.

We posit that the effectiveness of recurrent vision models is bottlenecked by the widespread algorithm used for training them, ""back-propagation through time"" (BPTT), which has O(N) memory-complexity for training an N step model. Thus, recurrent vision model design is bounded by memory constraints, forcing a choice between rivaling the enormous capacity of leading feedforward models or trying to compensate for this deficit through granular and complex dynamics. Here, we develop a new learning algorithm, ""contractor recurrent back-propagation"" (C-RBP), which alleviates these issues by achieving constant O(1) memory-complexity with steps of recurrent processing. We demonstrate that recurrent vision models trained with C-RBP can detect long-range spatial dependencies in a synthetic contour tracing task that BPTT-trained models cannot.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder in which substantial motor impairment is often observed.

But, if a new broadcast is emitted when echoes of the previous broadcast still are arriving, echoes from both broadcasts intermingle, creating ambiguity about which echo corresponds to which broadcast. One known solution is bats create consecutive echolocating calls with small frequency shifts (around 5 kHz) in the tail-end of FM1, so echoes from different broadcasts are grouped by carrying the same tail-end frequency as their corresponding pulses. But, computationally, how are echoes with a higher tail-end frequency as previous calls rejected in the auditory system while bats are analyzing echoes from the current call? We show that echoes need only the lowest FM1 broadcast frequencies of 25-30 kHz for delay perception. If these frequencies are removed, no delay is perceived.

Abstract

Action sequences constitute much of our everyday behavior. One important aspect of such sequences is their spatiotemporal pattern; a plane pilot must not only perform each action in the correct order but also at the precise time. Our project focuses on developing a neuro-computational model that learns to encode spatiotemporal representations of such tasks in the connectivity matrix of recurrent neural networks. We suggest this learning emerges from the combination of specific learning rules within the RNN, in combination of learned sparse feedback projection from motor cortex to the RNN signaling event boundaries (e.g., a motor response). In addition, we aim to understand how such a learned structure can be harnessed to efficiently generalize spatiotemporal representations. For instance, learning a drum rhythm with the hands and transfer it to feet effectors (between output generalization), or applying a learned rhythm to distinct sequences within the same effector (between sequence generalization).",Yes,,

Cognitive control encompasses multistage processes such as conflict monitoring, response threshold
adjustment, and response selection (Shenhav et al., 2013). However, little is known about how each process interacts with value-driven attention. To address this gap, we developed a modified
Flanker task combined with a reach-tracking paradigm. Participants reached to a target on the right or left side of the screen as instructed by a central arrow that was flanked by congruent, incongruent or neutral distractors. To manipulate value-based attention, the flankers were rendered in colors that had pre-trained associations with positive, negative, or no monetary outcomes. Previous studies suggest that, in the reach tracking paradigm, the initiation latency
(time taken to initiate the movement after stimulus presentation) captures adjustments in response threshold, while the reach curvature (degree of deviation in the reach trajectory from the direct path to the target) captures response selection (e.g., Erb et al., 2016). We found that
these two measures were differentially affected by distractor congruency and value. Initiation latency was reduced by congruent relative to neutral flankers, suggesting that congruency lowered response threshold. This reduction was attenuated by positive-reward compared to no-reward conditions. In contrast, curvature was increased on incongruent relative to neutral trials, suggesting that incongruent distractors interfere with response selection, and this effect
was not affected by flanker value. Together, it appears that both congruent and incongruent trials modulate different cognitive control processes, response threshold adjustment and response
selection respectively, whereas reward only modulates the former. Overall, this study uncovers the potential interactions underlying our cognitive control and value-based attention systems.",Yes,,

We live in a dynamic world, controlling our thoughts and actions to optimize costs and benefits. Optimal control theory offers a normative account of how to regulate these dynamical systems. While this modeling approach has been fruitfully applied to online motor control, much less is known about how optimal control can help us understand more abstract planning processes. To measure optimal control over abstract planning, we developed a novel experimental paradigm in which participants learned to control linear dynamical systems to earn rewards and avoid action costs. We used ‘Inverse Optimal Control’ to infer the objective functions that participants used to make their decisions, finding that we were able to accurately predict participants’ choices. Our modelling further revealed that participants were biased towards using quadratic objective functions, consistent with a standard family of optimal control algorithms. This work shows how optimal control theory can formalize people's decisions to exert effort in the service of their goals, motivating a future fMRI experiment to measure neural representation of the objective functions that participants use for planning. 


Lightning Talk: Modeling optimal approach-avoidance planning.
Animals must frequently choose between pursuing what they desire (e.g., drinking from a river) and avoiding what they fear (e.g., exposing themselves to predators). Effective, flexible planning requires that they combine these goal states with their knowledge about the dynamics of their environment (e.g., the agility of predators). Engineering control theory provides a normative framework for how agents can navigate these approach-avoidance conflicts, extending state-of-the-art motor control algorithms to more complex planning. We applied this approach to simulate an optimal agent’s movements as they try to reach a goal while avoiding a ‘predator’ that is chasing them.  We find that optimal control algorithms can produce a rich and flexible repertoire of actions, such as planning evasive maneuvers that lure predators away from desirable locations. These models have inspired a collaboration with a primate research group to test how control algorithms can be used to understand the neural correlates of dynamic approach-avoidance planning.

When repeating the task in novel environments resequencing of the tasks may be required, or additional subtasks may need to be introduced. Composing behavior from modular and composable units simplifies each learning task and vastly broadens the capabilities of the agent.

We formulate a novel representation of these subtasks, called a composable interaction primitive (CIP). Each CIP defines an initiation component that encapsulates the robot’s movement to a starting configuration for the execution of the subtask. While the desired motion trajectory of an initiation component can be solved using existing planning algorithms, they are prohibitively slow to recompute trajectories when tasks are resequenced in real-time.

For shapes with underlying hierarchical structure, such as part-based shapes, works in press introduce a generative model that captures purely structural variability, enabling coarse representation of each member of an object class. This generative model, a hierarchical Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), encodes and reconstructs programs in a domain-specific language called ShapeAssembly. ShapeAssembly programs describe how to construct a series of bounding cuboids that represent the part hierarchy of the original shape. One fundamental problem remains: generating fine-grained geometry from this structural prior. 
We propose a generative model conditioned on the latent encodings from ShapeAssembly that learns the style of the shape.

For example, input gating proactively updates information to memory that has been deemed 100% relevant to the task (high priority) and filters information that is irrelevant. Conversely, output gating manages the contents of VWM when relevance is known only after encoding. That is, when items must be remembered even though their relevance is uncertain. The present experiment investigated how information content in VWM differed for items that were input gated with 100% certainty, versus for items that were only potentially relevant. Participants were scanned on a VWM orientation gating task across two fMRI sessions. We used a Bayesian approach to compute the full probability distribution of the stimuli given the BOLD data during input gating and output gating events. This approach allowed us to reconstruct the orientations that participants saw in the scanner and estimate both the precision and accuracy of remembered orientations.

To investigate this link, we used multi-electrode arrays to record from a population of visual neurons in macaques while they performed a psychophysical task.

Unfortunately, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are notoriously difficult to interpret. However, their applications to time series data makes them an invaluable resource for signal processing and analysis.

We make use of particularly large kernel sizes in shallow CNNs to reduce the complexity of information flow through the network while maintaining a sufficiently high receptive field to extract relevant topological information from a dataset. However, potentially superfluous weights can degrade the interpretability of the network by acting as noise in the visualization of the kernels themselves. To address this, we propose a novel approach to minimize the jaggedness of a network’s convolutional filters by incorporating an additional loss function during the training process. The outcome is a smoother filter, which is easier to interpret by the human eye, yet still performs well in the network’s primary task.

In this project, we propose a GNN-based approach to brain MRI glioma segmentation. We model brain MRI scans as graphs composed of connected brain regions, and train several GNN variants to classify graph nodes, i.e. brain regions, as tumorous or healthy. Our preliminary results show that graph-based methods are potentially competitive with state-of-the-art CNN methods.

To integrate these datasets, I performed gene network analysis on the single nuclei, then used this gene network to simulate biologically-realistic single nuclei from each deep-seq dataset. Simulated nuclei from different retrograde injections align with different molecularly distinct subtypes of mitral cells from the sn-seq data, suggesting that molecular differences correspond to different projection targets.

We target this issue on the recent open-ended visual counting task which is well suited to study statistical shortcuts. We aim to develop models that learn a proper mechanism of counting regardless of the output label. First, we propose the Modifying Count Distribution (MCD) protocol, which penalizes models that over-rely on statistical shortcuts. It is based on pairs of training and testing sets that do not follow the same count label distribution such as the odd-even sets.

Adolescents’ greater vulnerability to CU effects may be due to the high concentrations of endogenous cannabinoid receptors in regions developing during adolescence (e.g., prefrontal and striatal). While CU may disrupt normal processes of adolescent brain development, relatively little is known about how adolescent CU is associated with brain/behavior mechanisms of reward-related decision-making. Advancing knowledge of these processes may explain why adolescent-onset CU is linked to functional impairments and higher rates of problematic substance use.
