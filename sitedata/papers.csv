HJxrVA4FDS,Disentangling neural mechanisms for perceptual grouping,Junkyung Kim*|Drew Linsley*|Kalpit Thakkar|Thomas Serre,"Forming perceptual groups and individuating objects in visual scenes is an essential step towards visual intelligence. This ability is thought to arise in the brain from computations implemented by bottom-up, horizontal, and top-down connections between neurons. However, the relative contributions of these connections to perceptual grouping are poorly understood. We address this question by systematically evaluating neural network architectures featuring combinations bottom-up, horizontal, and top-down connections on two synthetic visual tasks, which stress low-level ""Gestalt"" vs. high-level object cues for perceptual grouping. We show that increasing the difficulty of either task strains learning for networks that rely solely on bottom-up connections. Horizontal connections resolve straining on tasks with Gestalt cues by supporting incremental grouping, whereas top-down connections rescue learning on tasks with high-level object cues by modifying coarse predictions about the position of the target object. Our findings dissociate the computational roles of bottom-up, horizontal and top-down connectivity, and demonstrate how a model featuring all of these interactions can more flexibly learn to form perceptual groups.",recurrent feedback|visual cortex,
H1gB4RVKvB,Recurrent neural circuits for contour detection,Drew Linsley*|Junkyung Kim*|Alekh Ashok|Thomas Serre,"We introduce a deep recurrent neural network architecture that approximates visual cortical circuits (M√©ly et al., 2018). We show that this architecture, which we refer to as the ùú∏-net, learns to solve contour detection tasks with better sample efficiency than state-of-the-art feedforward networks, while also exhibiting a classic perceptual illusion, known as the orientation-tilt illusion. Correcting this illusion significantly reduces \gnetw contour detection accuracy by driving it to prefer low-level edges over high-level object boundary contours. Overall, our study suggests that the orientation-tilt illusion is a byproduct of neural circuits that help biological visual systems achieve robust and efficient contour detection, and that incorporating these circuits in artificial neural networks can improve computer vision.",computer vision|neural circuits|recurrent feedback|sample efficiency|visual cortex,
